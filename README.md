### Changes made

- In this commit the changes made are:

1. Install react-data-table-component from npm

2. Add a table component which has the following props
  - title
  - columns
  - data
  - defaultSortField
  - striped
  - pagination
  - subHeader

 - The defaultSortField, striped and pagination props have boolean values in which we choose if the table is striped, has pagination and default sorting functionalites

 - The title is just a text of the table title
 - The data is the data object with all the table row attributes, in our case, an array of obects like:

   ```
    const data = [
    {
      id: 1,
      customer: "John Deo",
      order_id: "91412314",
      photo: "/assets/chris_evans.jpg",
      product: {
        name: "iPhone 8",
        quantity: 10
      },
      date: "17-2-2017",
      status: "Pending",
      showButtons: true
    },
    {
        id: 1,
        customer: "David Heys",
        order_id: "91412314",
        photo: "/assets/chris_evans.jpg",
        product: {
          name: "iPhone 8",
          quantity: 10
        },
        date: "17-2-2017",
        status: "Pending",
        showButtons: true
      },

    ```
 - The columns is also an object that maps the table rows attributes with the data object.

   ```

     const columns = [
    {
      name: "Customer",
      selector: "customer",
      sortable: true,
      grow: 2
    },
    {
      name: "OrderId",
      selector: "order_id",
      sortable: true,
      hide: "sm"
    },

  ```

    It also allows has a `cell` optional attribute so that we can have a node inside the row cell and it takes the row argument. With this option we can render buttons and inner components with custom styling. In addition, the buttons can have `onClick` event handlers, which can be used to edit or delete the `row` data. Unfortunately, I could not work on the button click events due to time limitations.
